Hello!!

What is this project? 

At first my intention was to create a blog app. I guess now it looks like a mix of Twitter and Snapchat - just a tiny one. You can call it FakeBook :D


The user has a profile like personal url where he can share messages visible to everyone.
But unlike Twitter, there is only one message the user can post on his feed. Every post replaces the previous one, so it's like a status update, where you share only recent stuff. Of course the users previous messages are stored but not visible. Messages you share have Tag title, which adds the Tag as "Interests" for the user in database when you like a posted message.


The signup, login, post/delete/like message features are ready. I will add test cases next. My plan is to finish the project after that. The final state of the project might be a bit different, don't be surprised later :)
