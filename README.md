Hello!!

What is this project? 

At first my intention was to create a blog app.
But to make a better use of RabbitMQ, I pushed a bit further. I guess it will look like a mix of Twitter and Snapchat - just a tiny one. You can call it FakeBook :D


The user will have profile like personal page where he can share message visible to everyone.
But unlike Twitter, there is only one message the user can post on his feed. Every post replaces the previous one, so it will be like a status update, where you share recent stuff. Of course the users previous messages will be stored but will not be visible. Messages you share will have Tag title, which will add the Tag as Interest for the user in another database when you like a posted message. I'm working to find a way to make the interested tags to have priority to appear users. I will figure it out eventually :)


The sign up and login part is ready. I will add admin/mod features next. My plan is to add Like feature after that. I might make changes in future, dont be surprised later :)
